resume_header_intro: <b>Bio.</b> I'm a Rheumatology Fellow at Columbia University School of Medicine working in the lab of <a href="https://www.rheumatologyatcolumbia.org/profile/robert-j-winchester-md">Robert Winchester</href>. I am responsible for the acquisition, optimization and analysis of multicolor and spectral flow cytometry data to study the interface between the innate and the adaptive immune system. My research focuses on understanding of the potential pathologic functions of dendritic cells (DC) and their interactions with other immune cells in the context of autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Lupus (SLE). <p>I am particularly interested in novel approaches to the analysis of complex data as it is generated in multicolor and spectral flow cytometry experiments, and methods to integrate that data with clinical information.<p>Our goal is to detect the cellular mechanisms that are responsible for the development and maintenance of autoimmune diseases and to ultimately enable new targeted therapies that improve lives with people living with autoimmune diseases such as RA and Lupus.
